# DarBright Playwright Production Features

This document describes the production-ready features added to DarBright Playwright.

## VSCode Extension

Located in `packages/playwright-vscode/`

### Features
- Test discovery and management
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support
- Power Platform integration
- Command palette integration
- Real-time test execution

### Installation
```bash
cd packages/playwright-vscode
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
```

This creates `darbright-playwright-1.0.0.vsix` which can be installed in VSCode:
```bash
code --install-extension darbright-playwright-1.0.0.vsix
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

The extension includes an MCP server that exposes Playwright functionality to AI agents and tools.

### Available Tools
- `playwright_run_test` - Execute Playwright tests
- `playwright_record_test` - Record new tests using codegen
- `playwright_generate_locator` - Generate element locators
- `playwright_open_trace` - Open trace viewer

### Configuration
Enable in VSCode settings:
```json
{
    "darbright-playwright.mcpEnabled": true,
    "darbright-playwright.mcpPort": 8080
}
```

## Power Platform Integration

Provides RESTful API for Power Platform agents to use Playwright automation.

### Available Actions
- `playwright.navigate` - Navigate to web pages
- `playwright.click` - Click elements
- `playwright.fillText` - Fill form fields
- `playwright.getText` - Extract text content
- `playwright.screenshot` - Capture screenshots
- `playwright.waitForElement` - Wait for elements

### API Endpoints
- `GET /tools` - List available tools
- `POST /tools/execute` - Execute tools
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /manifest` - Integration manifest

### Configuration
Enable in VSCode settings:
```json
{
    "darbright-playwright.powerPlatformEnabled": true
}
```

## MSIX Package

Located in `packages/msix-package/`

Windows application package for easy distribution and installation.

### Build MSIX Package
```bash
cd packages/msix-package
npm run build
```

### Contents
- VSCode extension (.vsix file)
- Application manifest
- Installation scripts
- Required image assets

### Installation
On Windows systems with MSIX support:
1. Double-click the `.msix` file
2. Follow installation prompts
3. The package includes the VSCode extension and setup scripts

## End-to-End Testing

Basic functionality tests are included in `tests/mcp/basic.spec.js`

### Run Tests
```bash
npx playwright test tests/mcp/basic.spec.js
```

### Test Coverage
- MCP server functionality
- Power Platform tool definitions
- VSCode extension packaging
- MSIX package structure

## Production Deployment

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- VSCode 1.74+
- Windows 10/11 (for MSIX)

### Setup Steps
1. Build all packages: `npm run build`
2. Package VSCode extension: `cd packages/playwright-vscode && npm run package`
3. Build MSIX package: `cd packages/msix-package && npm run build`
4. Deploy as needed for your environment

### Integration with AI Agents
The MCP server allows AI agents to:
- Execute Playwright tests programmatically
- Record new test scenarios
- Generate robust element locators
- Access trace data for debugging

### Power Platform Usage
Power Platform flows can use the REST API to:
- Automate web browser interactions
- Extract data from web applications
- Perform automated testing workflows
- Capture screenshots for documentation

## Security Considerations

- MCP server runs on localhost only by default
- Power Platform integration requires explicit enablement
- All network communication uses standard protocols
- File system access is limited to workspace directories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **VSCode extension not loading**: Check that all dependencies are installed
2. **MCP server not starting**: Verify port availability and firewall settings
3. **Power Platform connection failed**: Ensure integration is enabled in settings
4. **MSIX installation failed**: Check Windows version compatibility

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in VSCode settings:
```json
{
    "darbright-playwright.debug": true
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced AI agent integration
- Additional Power Platform connectors
- Improved MSIX packaging with digital signing
- Extended MCP tool capabilities
- Performance optimizations
